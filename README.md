# HELLO AND WELCOME TO MY ANGULARJS WEATHER APP!

## My *first* AngularJS app.

### To run the app, navigate to where you'd like it to be in your terminal, and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/lauriemcgee/lmcgee-weather-app.git
cd lmcgee-weather-app
npm install
npm run build
npm run server

```

Your newly created weather app will now be running in your localhost!
